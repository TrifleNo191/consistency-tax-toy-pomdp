# Consistency Tax — Toy POMDP simulations

This repository contains toy POMDP simulations to empirically explore CT = λ·D_KL(P || P*).

Quickstart:
- Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run tests: pytest

Goals:
- Provide reproducible simulation code and tests.
- Link to the paper repo and show how experiments reproduce the paper's claims.

Recommended next steps:
- Add a stable entrypoint script (e.g., run_sim.py) that saves deterministic outputs.
- Add example pytest tests that validate small properties of simulation outputs.
- Consider adding a reproducibility badge that links the paper repo and experiment repo.
